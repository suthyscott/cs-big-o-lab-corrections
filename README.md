This repo contains fixes for the Big O lecture slides and lab solutions.

The `slide-correction` folder contains an incorrect example that many of the original lab solutions were based on. The `slide-correction.md` file contains an explanation of the mistake in the slide, as well as an accurate example of a function with linear space complexity.
